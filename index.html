        <h2><a class="item2"href="https://climate.nasa.gov/">Climate Change </a>is the long-term alteration of temperature and typical weather patterns in a place. Climate change could refer to a particular location or the planet as a whole. Climate change may cause weather patterns to be less predictable.</h2>
        
        <h3> Everyone can help limit climate change. From the way we travel, to the electricity we use and the food we eat, we can make a difference. Start with these three actions to help tackle the climate crisis.</h3>

                <p> <h2 class= "aqua"><a class= "item2"href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/causes-effects-climate-change">Save Energy at Home</a></h2>Much of our electricity and heat are powered by coal, oil, and gas. Use less energy by lowering your heating and cooling, switching to LED light bulbs and energy-efficient electric appliances, washing your laundry with cold water, or hanging things to dry instead of using a dryer.</p>

                 <p> <h2 class= "pink">Walk, Bike, or Take public transport</h2>The worldâ€™s roadways are clogged with vehicles, most of them burning diesel or gasoline. Walking or riding a bike instead of driving will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help your health and fitness. For longer distances, consider taking a train or bus. And carpool whenever possible.</p>

                 <p> <h2 class= "Bisque"> Reduce, Reuse, Repair & Recycle </h2> Electronics, clothes, and other items we buy cause carbon emissions at each point in production, from the extraction of raw materials to manufacturing and transporting goods to market. To protect our climate, buy fewer things, shop second-hand, repair what you can, and recycle.</p>
